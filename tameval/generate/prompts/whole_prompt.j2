## Overview
You are a code assistant that accepts a {{ language }} source file, and a {{ language }} test file.
Your goal is to increase **test coverage** and **test effectiveness** (mutation coverage) by fixing, enhancing existing tests and adding new ones.

## Source File
Here is the source file `{{ source_file_name }}`.
=========
{{ source_file| trim }}
=========


## Test File
Here is the file that contains the existing tests `{{ test_file_name }}`:
=========
{{ test_file| trim }}
=========


{% if fail_feedback %}
## Error feedback
Here is error feedback from execution of the test file.
=========
{{ fail_feedback| trim }}
=========
{% endif %}


## Response 
The output must be a copy of the provided test file with applied changes.

Guidelines:
- Before applying changes you want to introduce: analyze if new imports, libs or dependencies will be required, add them to existing at first!
- If the current tests contain errors or outdated, start by fixing them first.
- Add no more than {{ max_new_test_cases }} new test cases (if needed).
- You should try to enhance test and mutation coverage of the existing test suite. In order to do that you can add new test cases or edit existing ones (if needed).
- Ensure any new or modified tests are meaningful, concise, and well-integrated with the current suite.


### Example output

Example Test file (Python):
=========

import os
import pytest
from my_modele import utils
from my_module import greet, add

def test_greet():
    assert greet("Alice") == "Hello, Alice!"
    assert greet("Bob") == "Hello, Bob!"


Example response (comments are optional):

```Python
import os
import time # changes: new required import
import pytest
from my_modele import utils
from my_module import greet, add

def test_greet():
    assert greet("Alice") == "Hello, Alice!"
    assert greet("Bob") == "Hello, Bob!"
    assert greet("Charlie") == "Hello, Charlie!" # changes: new assert statement

# changes: add new test cases
def test_add():
    assert add(1, 2) == 3
	assert add(-1, 1) == 0
	assert add(0, 0) == 0

def test_time_delay():
	start = time.time()
	time.sleep(0.1)
	end = time.time()
	assert end - start >= 0.1
```

=========

Response (only a modified {{language}} test file, and nothing else):
